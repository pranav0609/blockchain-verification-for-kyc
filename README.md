We made a KYC application that uses blockchain as a database which ensures security and privacy of a user. This application is tested on a local test network such as Ganache using truffle and web3.js. 

# Techonologies Used
frontend - ReactJS
backend - Ethereum Developement Network (Ganache), web3.js, truffle

# Commands
  1) to run the front end, cd into client folder and then npm install or npm i to install all the dependencies
  2) truffle migrate -- reset
  3) ganache-cli or you can use the Ganache Application

# Things to keep in mind before running the code
  1) Since this project only supports development networks, check if Ganache Network is running behind.
  2) Also remember to change port to 8545 from 7545 if using ganache-cli.
  3) Do make sure you create bank accounts before creating a customer.
